# Important Data Points (`Important_DPs.py`)

## Overview
The `Important_DPs.py` script defines the `Important_DPs` class, which represents important data points (DPs) within a flag. These data points are crucial for identifying key levels and potential reactions in the price data.

## Workflow
1. **Initialization**:
   - Load configuration from `config.json`.
   - Define the `Important_DPs` class with attributes for the dataset, direction, flag ID, and start index.

2. **Methods**:
   - `__init__()`: Initializes an `Important_DPs` object with the provided attributes.
   - `calculate_DP()`: Calculates the important data points based on the dataset and direction.
   - `validate_DP()`: Validates the calculated data points to ensure they meet certain criteria.
   - `__repr__()`: Returns a string representation of the `Important_DPs` object.

## Key Functions
- `__init__()`: Initializes an `Important_DPs` object.
- `calculate_DP()`: Calculates the important data points.
- `validate_DP()`: Validates the calculated data points.
- `__repr__()`: String representation of the `Important_DPs` object.

## Algorithm
1. **Initialization**:
   - Load the dataset and configuration.
   - Set the direction, flag ID, and start index.

2. **Calculate Data Points**:
   - Identify key levels in the dataset based on the direction (Bullish or Bearish).
   - Calculate the important data points (DPs) using the specified algorithm.

3. **Validate Data Points**:
   - Ensure the calculated data points meet the criteria defined in the configuration.
   - Adjust the data points if necessary to ensure they are valid.

## Next Steps
- Add methods to merge data points from multiple flags.
- Implement strategies for validating and adjusting data points.
